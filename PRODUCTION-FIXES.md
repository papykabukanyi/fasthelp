RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT - PRODUCTION FIXES APPLIED
============================================

ðŸš€ CRITICAL FIXES FOR 502 ERROR:

âœ… 1. REMOVED SERVER CRASHES:
- Removed process.exit(1) for invalid Redis URL
- Made Redis completely optional 
- Added graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies
- EmailTemplateHelper made optional with fallback

âœ… 2. SIMPLIFIED RAILWAY CONFIG:
- Updated nixpacks.toml with direct Node.js setup
- Simplified build process: install dependencies â†’ build React â†’ start server
- Removed complex build scripts that could fail
- Direct "node server.js" start command

âœ… 3. DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION:
- Fixed React build issues with TailwindCSS v4
- All npm packages install correctly  
- React app builds to client/dist/
- Server serves React app in production

âœ… 4. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
- Made Redis URL optional (app works without Redis)
- Only JWT_SECRET is required (with secure fallback)
- Railway automatically provides PORT and NODE_ENV
- Updated .env.example with Railway-specific guidance

âœ… 5. PRODUCTION SERVING:
- Server serves React build in production
- Static files served correctly
- API routes working (/health, /ping, /api/*)
- Catch-all route for React Router

ðŸ”§ DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION:

package.json scripts:
- start: "node server.js" 
- railway-build: builds React app
- All dependencies properly listed

nixpacks.toml:
- Uses nodejs_18
- Installs root and client dependencies
- Builds React app
- Starts with "node server.js"

railway.json:
- Direct node server.js start
- Health check on /health
- 5 restart retries
- 300s timeout

ðŸš¨ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES TO SET IN RAILWAY:
1. JWT_SECRET=<32+ character random string>
2. REDIS_URL=<optional, only if using Redis service>

The app should now start successfully on Railway and respond to requests!
