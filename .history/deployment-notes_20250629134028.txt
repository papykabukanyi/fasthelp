âœ… No blocking operations whatsoever during startup

TESTED & VERIFIED:
âœ… Configuration loads correctly (npm run test)
âœ… Redis URL properly formatted and accessible
âœ… JWT secret configured with secure fallback
âœ… Health endpoints responding (/health, /api/health)
âœ… Server startup resilient to Redis connection issues
âœ… Railway-compatible build configurationLWAY DEPLOYMENT READY
