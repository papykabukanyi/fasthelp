FAST HELP - BUILD ISSUES FIXED
===============================

✅ FIXED TailwindCSS Build Error:
- Updated to TailwindCSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- Replaced PostCSS configuration with Vite plugin approach  
- Simplified CSS to use @import "tailwindcss" instead of @layer directives
- Install @tailwindcss/vite for proper Vite integration

✅ KEPT ORIGINAL SERVER.JS:
- Updated original server.js (not creating new files)
- Added React app serving for production
- Added static file serving for React build assets
- Added catch-all route for React Router
- Added missing /api/admin/stats endpoint
- Maintained all existing functionality

✅ BUILD PROCESS WORKS:
- React app builds successfully to client/dist/
- All npm packages install correctly
- TailwindCSS compiles without errors
- Production build ready for deployment

✅ RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT READY:
- Uses original server.js as requested
- Builds React app during deployment
- Serves React app in production
- Maintains all existing API routes
- Health checks working (/health, /ping)

DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS:
1. cd client && npm install
2. cd client && npm run build  
3. node server.js (serves React app + API)

The app now works as a complete React + Node.js application while keeping the original server.js file structure as requested.
